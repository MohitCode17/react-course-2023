ğŸ‘‰ Event Handling

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

There are some syntax differences:
- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>

- is slightly different in React:

<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
