ðŸ‘‰ Rendering List

You will often want to display multiple similar components from a collection of data. You can use the JavaScript array methods to manipulate an array of data. We use the map() function to iterate over the list and render the results.

keys help identify what item from the list has changed to inform React to re-render. ReactJS gives a warning if you forget to mention the keys for a list.


Example of Map:-

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);


ðŸ‘‰ Rendering Multiple Components

Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);

Then, we can include the entire listItems array inside a <ul> element:

<ul>{listItems}</ul>
