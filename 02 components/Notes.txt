ğŸ‘‰ What is Components ?

Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI).

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML called JSX.

Example:-

function Gallery() {
    return (
        ---- HTML code -----
    )
}


ğŸ‘‰ How to Define a Components and Reuse it:-

Step-1 Define a component

function Profile(){
    return (
        <h1>John Doe</h1>
    )
}


Step-2 Export the component

export default Profile;

The export default prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files.


Step-3 Using a component( App.js file )

First we'll import compoent, so that we can use.

import Profile from './Profile'

function App () {
    return (
        <Profile/>
        <Profile/>
        <Profile/>
    )
}



ğŸ‘‰ Note: 
1. React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they wonâ€™t work!
2. Components can render other components, but you must never nest their definitions:

function App(){
    function Profile() {
        ............ code here ............
    }
}
