ğŸ‘‰ What is JSX ?

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.


Note: JSX and React are two separate things. Theyâ€™re often used together, but you can use them independently of each other. JSX is a syntax extension, while React is a JavaScript library.


ğŸ‘‡ Take a look at the below code:-

const jsx = <h1>This is JSX</h1>;

This is simple JSX code in React. But the browser does not understand this JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code. This is because we're assigning an HTML tag to a variable that is not a string but just HTML code.
So to convert it to browser understandable JavaScript code, we use a tool like 'Babel' which is a JavaScript compiler/transpiler.


ğŸ‘‰ Valid JS Expression in JSX

With JSX you can write expressions inside { } curly brackets.
Expression can be react variable, a valid javascript expression or any other valid property.

Example: const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX.</h1>


ğŸ‘‰ JSX follows some Rules

1. Return a single root element

To return multiple elements from a component, wrap them with a single parent tag.

For example, you can use a <div> or ou can write <> and </> instead(This empty tag is called a Fragment):

<div>

    <h1>What makes React Special</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Component Approach</li>
        <li>Declarative Approach</li>
    </ul>
</div>


2. Close all the tags 

Always self-close empty element with like: <br/>, <input/>, <hr/> in HTML we define same elements like <br>, <input> etc.

<img src="xyz.png" alt="xyz" />


3. camelCase all most of the things!

The names canâ€™t contain dashes or be reserved words like class.

background-color => backgroundColor
font-size => fontSize

Use 'className' instead of 'class'.
