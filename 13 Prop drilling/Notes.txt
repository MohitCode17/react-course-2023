ğŸ‘‰ What is Prop Drilling ?

Prop drilling occurs when a parent component passes data down to its children and then those children pass the same data down to their own children. This process can continue indefinitely. At the end, it's a long chain of component dependencies that can be difficult to manage and maintain.

Prop drilling can lead to several issues in your codebase, let's bring it on surface:

1. Code Duplication
2. Increase the cognitive load on developers who need to understand and navigate the component hierarchy
3. Decreased Maintainability
